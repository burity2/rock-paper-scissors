# brick-papyrus-khopesh

Project made in during the Foundations Course, by The Odin's Project.
Main goal:
- Learn basic JS synthax
- Create an UI and apply DOM manipulation

Personal Note:
This started small, just the console game; then it had an UI, then it was the requested project by Codeworks to apply JQuery. I had fun doing this one, it was so confusing at first but now, looking back, seems so easy! We level up in unseen ways...
